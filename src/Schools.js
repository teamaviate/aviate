Ofcourse mathematics and physics are the basics to get into robotics. We just dont teach robotics instead we will relate the robotics to the mathematics and physics through which the students get double benefited through the hands on experience which will make them understand the mathematics as well as physics like they never thought of them as if they were that easy. This will certainly develop the logical thinking and the programmers in them.</p>

                            <p  className="text-justify"> In the current automated world, the education system managed to change the method of learning as well as teaching. Teaching robotics to students in their academics can induce their ability to be creative and innovative thinkers and more productive members of society. Many governments have already recognized the importance of robotics in the classroom and have begun to create programs and laws that would incorporate it into their public education system. By teaching our students the basics of robotics, we can open a whole new world to them and exciting opportunities that they wouldnâ€™t have access to otherwise.</p><br/><br/>
